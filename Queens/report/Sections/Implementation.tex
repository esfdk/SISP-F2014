% 2d-array of BDDs
% one overall BDD

% init -> build BDD -> add rules -> insert queen -> restrict BDD -> get valid domains -> update board

\subsection{Building the BDD}

\subsection{Adding the rules for the problem}

\subsection{Inserting a queen}

\subsection{Getting the valid positions}
We calculate the valid positions by iterating over every position on the board and attempting to place a queen on that position by restricting that position to true. If the restricted BDD is not zero (false), then that position is valid.
