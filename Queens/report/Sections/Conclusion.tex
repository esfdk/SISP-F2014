\label{Conclusion}
We conclude that we have successfully implemented the N-Queens configurator using the supplied BDD package. We have tested our solution on board sizes 1-12. The configurator offers no solutions on sizes 2-4 (as there are none for the Queens problem). On our machines, the configurator runs at an acceptable speed.
