\section{Our implementation of Minimax}
\label{Our_Version}
The MiniMax algorithm is an adversarial search algorithm. The search is performed as a depth-first search. When a terminal state is reached, the utility of the state is calculated and propagates up the search tree. The different branches of the tree are picked according to which player is making the move in the tree. The algorithm assumes that MAX (the player making the decision) will try to maximize his/her utility while MIN (the adversary of MAX) will attempt to minimize the utility of MAX.

In our implementation of MiniMax we have modified the algorithm to cut-off at a certain depth and then evaluate the board state at that depth based on a heuristic called (\textit{n-out-of-4}.
